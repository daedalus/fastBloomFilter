Description: 
        This module provides Python bindings for the LZO data compression library.
        
        LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
        It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
        Decompression requires no memory.
        
        In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
        competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
        this very high speed.
Platform: All
