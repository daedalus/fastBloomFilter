# Simple and fast pythonic bloomfilter

From wikipedia: "A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a "counting" filter); the more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives."


### This filter supports: ###

```
- Saving, reloading, compressed bloomfilter file lrzip like: 
        for compression: lz4>lzo>zlib>bz2>lzma
        for decompression: lzma>bz2>zlib>lzo>lz4
         (This functionality might be deprecated, is better to use pickle for the bloom filter
        than to manage loading and saving by ourselves.)
- Stats
- Entropy analysis
- Internal and external hashing of data.
- raw filter merging
```


### Installing: ###

```
sudo pip install fastbloomfilter
```

### External creation of the bloom filter file: ###

```
python mkbloom.py /tmp/filter.blf
```

### Importing: ###

```
from fastBloomFilter import bloom
bf = bloom.BloomFilter(filename='/tmp/filter.blf')
```

### Adding data to it: ###

```
bf.add('30000')
bf.add('1230213')
bf.add('1')
```

### Printing stats: ###

```
bf.stat()
```
   
Or:

```
bf.info()
```

### Querying data: ###

```
print(bf.query('1')) # True
print(bf.query('1230213')) # True
print(bf.query('12')) # False
```   

### Querying data and at the same time adding it: ###

```
print(bf.update('1')) # True
print(bf.update('1')) # True
print(bf.update('2')) # False
print(bf.update('2')) # True
```
